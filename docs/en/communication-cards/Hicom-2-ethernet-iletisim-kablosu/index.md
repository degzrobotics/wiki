# About the Product


Two Pin Twisted Pair Communication Cable is a communication cable with high strength and neutral buoyancy, especially preferred in underwater working areas.

Thanks to the polyurethane outer sheath, it has high strength and high flexibility. The polyurethane sheath is much more resistant to breakage and tearing than other types of materials.

The cable contains Kevlar wires for strength and Dacron fibers for gap filling. Dacron fibers are combined with a water blocking compound to prevent leaks from nicks or tears in the cable. High visibility yellow polyurethane foam sheath resists abrasion and provides neutral buoyancy.

The flexibility of the cable is designed to be high enough to give the Deringezen plenty of freedom, but stiff enough not to tangle easily.
