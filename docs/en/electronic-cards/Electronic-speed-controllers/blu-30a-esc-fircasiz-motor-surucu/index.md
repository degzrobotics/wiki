# Blu 30A ESC - Brushless Motor Driver

![Blu Esc](./image/escblu.jpg)

This motor drive is specially configured for underwater motors, bi-directional and compatible with Blheli and Blheli_S configuration systems. It supports Dshot150, Dshot300 and Dshot600 protocols and can operate in a wide voltage range between 8v-24v (2s-6s on battery). It has a maximum current capacity of 30 amps and instantaneous current capacity of 35 amps, with protection in case of overheating. It has dimensions of 36x20x5mm and weighs 13 grams with cables. With PWM control, it supports full forward motion up to 2000 microseconds, stop at 1500 microseconds and full reverse at 1000 microseconds, while the stop accuracy is in the range of +-1 microsecond.
