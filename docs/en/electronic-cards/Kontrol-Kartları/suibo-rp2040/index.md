## Suibo ready to dive



![Degz suibo](./image/suibo-control-card-1.jpg)


Suibo is an advanced control board designed for use in various robotics and automation projects. The board features 9-axis stabilization for autonomy and precision control needs and includes important sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer and compass sensors. It can be used with a dual-core ARM M0 microcontroller, 8 MB external flash memory, IMU sensor and programmable LEDs. Furthermore, Suibo comes compatible with the Deep Diver ecosystem, which provides access to rich features such as the Dive Control Interface and the Python-based Dive Commander autopilot command library. Technically, it offers a flexible supply voltage between 3.3V and 6V and is compatible with various communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, RS485), making it suitable for many different projects, from unmanned underwater vehicles to rocket control systems. Suibo's design, adaptability and wide range of connections bring diversity and flexibility to your projects.
