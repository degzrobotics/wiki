# Use of the product

## Using the Blue 30A ESC

Its three connectors are connected to the motor phases of the Mitras Underwater Thruster. These connections provide power to the motor's brushless coils in different sequences, ensuring precise speed control and efficient operation.
The red and thick black cable of the ESC is connected to the positive and negative inputs of the batteries.

As for the thin black and white wires, they are used to send signals and play a role in controlling the motor.
