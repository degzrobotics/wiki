There are solder pads in the areas indicated by the arrow on the board. When you solder the two of these pads shown with colored markings, you will get a 5v 5000mA output from the left side, that is, from the Vout 2 output. From the right side, that is, from the Vout 1 output, you will get a 12v 4000mA bit output.

::::info
You can get 5 volts or 12 volts from two outputs at the same time according to your needs.
