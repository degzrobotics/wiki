# D300 Depth and Water Temperature Sensor


![Pressure sensor](./image/basinc-sensor.jpg)

This depth and temperature sensor is developed using the MS5837-30BA module and is capable of measuring pressure with an accuracy of 1cm and temperature with an accuracy of ±1°C to a depth of 300 meters. It communicates data over the I2C protocol and uses a 3.3V I2C voltage while operating with a supply voltage between 4.5-5.5V. The sensor includes a warning against the risk of damage when connected to devices operating with 5V I2C voltage. Compatible with PixHawk and similar flight control boards, this device can also be used in ArduPilot and ArduSub supported vehicles.
