# About the Product

Our sealed chamber has been developed to protect the electronic system in underwater vehicles. It is the only sealed chamber developed using patented transfer technology. Thanks to the PCB transfer board on the outer surface of the chamber, it can be easily used in all kinds of underwater designs.
