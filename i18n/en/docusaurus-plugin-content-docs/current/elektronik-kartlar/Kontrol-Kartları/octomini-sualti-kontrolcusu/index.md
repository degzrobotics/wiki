![Octomini Sualtı](./image/octomini2-Ozel.jpg)

Octomini is a developer board based on the Arduino Nano microcontroller and designed specifically for unmanned underwater vehicles. The board is small in size, under 55mm in diameter, and inspired by the FPV (First Person View) stack design to increase portability and ease of use. Thanks to the switching elements on it, it allows to control auxiliary systems of underwater vehicles such as lighting, gripper arms or sampling devices from the surface. Technically it offers five plus one PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs and provides stabilization with the Mpu6050 gyroscope. Communication over a theoretical distance of up to 400 meters is supported via the Canbus communication module. It can take supply voltage from 7 to 12 Volts and can control three different devices with a switching capacity of up to 5 amps. The board is equipped with features such as pressure sensor input, voltage measurement and extra analog pins. Both Octomini's software and hardware are fully open source, allowing users to download and customize the software or contribute to the project.
