Subdrive Lo-Base Power Distribution Board is a tool used to control the energy management of electronic devices. Thanks to its static magnetic switching feature, it can safely disconnect and connect the power flow of devices without touching them. This board is suitable for 6-26 Vdc input voltage and battery configurations from 2s to 6s, and thanks to its built-in regulator, it supports devices requiring both 5v and 12v. It meets high current requirements with a maximum load capacity of 150 amps and thanks to its cooling system, it provides 80 amps of continuous current and 40 amps of continuous current when used without regulator. It also allows to control multiple devices with independent switching elements and can monitor the energy consumption in the system with the current measurement sensor on it. The board also offers the ability to perform switching remotely, making power management more flexible.
