# VESC 6.9 100A(Max 200A) High Power Motor Driver- Flipsky

![Vesc Motor Driver](./image/vesc69-100a-motor-surucu.jpg)

VESC is an open source motor drive that can operate in a voltage range from 14V to 60V and can provide 100A continuous and up to 200A instantaneous current. With a variety of control modes, it supports DC, BLDC and FOC (sinusoidal) modes and offers energy recovery with regenerative braking. VESC has USB, CAN and UART ports, is compatible with sensors such as ABI, HALL, AS5047 and is programmable. Measuring 75.4×63.7×31.1mm, this driver is equipped with various protection functions such as low and high voltage protection, overcurrent and high temperature protection and supports accelerometer modules, offering a wide range of applications for your electric vehicle projects.
