# VESC 6.7 70A High Power Motor Driver - Flipsky

![VESC 60V](./image/vesc67-70a-motor-surucu.jpg)
The VESC motor driver is an open source motor controller that can operate over a wide voltage range from 14V to 60V and can provide a maximum current of 70A continuous and 200A instantaneous. This motor drive supports various control modes such as DC, BLDC and FOC (sinusoidal) and can provide energy recovery with regenerative braking. It is compatible with many ports such as USB, CAN and UART and sensors such as ABI, HALL, AS5047. With its programmable structure and VESC Tool software, users can customize motor drives according to their needs. It also has protection functions for low and high voltage, over current and high temperature. With dimensions of 67x39x18.7mm, this motor drive offers a flexible and safe solution for various applications.


# Product Technical Specifications

:::warning
Since VESC operates with high voltage up to 60V, it must be used with care!
